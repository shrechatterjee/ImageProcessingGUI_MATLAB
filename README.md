A GUI which can be used to select ROIs in images interactively
% skc105@ecs.soton.ac.uk
%This code creates a GUI to interactively select ROI's as per different thresholds for Upper, Middle and Lower Images. A histogram plot
% enables to find the optimum threshold for the particular segment of the
% image. The target images are saved (with different segments binarized as
% per the chosen thresholds for each segments) with their names appended. The threshold values can be saved into an
% excel sheet.
